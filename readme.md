# Network Anomaly Detection

## Overview
This project involves capturing network packets, preprocessing them, and performing anomaly detection using both Machine Learning and pattern-based approaches.

## File Descriptions
- `packet_capture.py`: Captures network packets and saves them as PCAP.
- `preprocess_packets.py`: Converts PCAP files to CSV format.
- `ml_anomaly_detection.py`: Anomaly detection using an AutoEncoder.
- `regex_matching.py`: Anomaly detection using regex patterns.
- `snort_setup.txt`: Instructions to set up Snort for packet capturing.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
2. Capture packets:
3. Preprocess packets:

4. Perform anomaly detection:
- ML-based:
  ```
  python ml_anomaly_detection.py
  ```
- Regex-based:
  ```
  python regex_matching.py
  ```

## Snort Setup
Refer to `snort_setup.txt` for instructions.
